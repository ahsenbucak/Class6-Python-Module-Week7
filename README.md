## 1. India

Write a method in Python to read lines from a text file `india.txt`, to find and display the occurrence of the word 'India'. For example, if the content of the file is:

```
India is the fastest-growing economy. India is 
looking for more investments around the globe. The 
whole world is looking at India as a great market. 
Most of the Indians can foresee the heights that 
India is capable of reaching.
```
The output should be 4.

## 2. Alphabet

1. Write a program to create function `letters_file_line` such that it accepts one variable stating number of letters on each line.
2. This function creates `words.txt` file where all letters of English alphabet are listed by specified number of letters on each line.
3. Example output when user input is 12:
```
words.txt

ABCDEFGHIJKL
MNOPQRSTUVWX
YZ
```

## 3. CSV to JSON
Assume you have a file called `data.csv`. Its input is as follows:

```
Symbol,Company,Price
GOOG,"Google Inc.",800
AAPL,"Apple Inc.",500
AMZN,"Amazon.com Inc.",250
YHOO,"Yahoo! Inc.",250
FB,"Facebook, Inc.",30
```

Read the CSV file and convert it into JSON file. Ask the user the expected CSV and JSON file paths.

## 4. Users
First create a file called users.csv and then work on the following two functions:

1. `print_names` - prints out all of the first and last names in the users.csv file
2. `add_name` - prompts us to enter a first and last name and adds it to the users.csv file

Don't forget to add header to csv file

## 5. To Json

1. Create a `Product` class with attribute `name`, `brand` and `price`.
2. Add `toJson` method to `Product` class. The method should convert class object to JSON.
3. Create a `Brand` class with attribute `name` and `year`.
4. Create a `Product` object and use `Brand` object for `brand` field.
4. Call `toJson` method.
